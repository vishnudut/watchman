# Watchman: Autonomous Security Scanner

## 🛡️ About the Project

**Watchman** is an intelligent, autonomous security scanning platform that revolutionizes how development teams approach application security. Built for hackathons and production environments alike, Watchman automatically detects security vulnerabilities in code repositories, leverages AI to provide intelligent analysis and fixes, and seamlessly integrates into existing development workflows.

### The Vision

In today's fast-paced development world, security often becomes an afterthought. Developers push code rapidly, and security vulnerabilities slip through the cracks until it's too late. Watchman was born from the realization that **security should be automated, intelligent, and developer-friendly**.

## 🚀 What Inspired This Project

### The Problem We're Solving

1. **Manual Security Reviews are Slow**: Traditional security audits happen too late in the development cycle
2. **False Positives Overwhelm Developers**: Most security tools generate noise rather than actionable insights
3. **Context is Lost**: Security findings often lack the business context needed for proper prioritization
4. **Integration Gaps**: Security tools don't integrate seamlessly into modern CI/CD workflows

### The "Aha!" Moment

The inspiration struck during a late-night debugging session when we realized that **AI could bridge the gap between raw security findings and actionable developer insights**. Instead of just flagging potential issues, what if we could:

- Automatically analyze security findings with business context
- Generate intelligent fixes with explanations
- Create GitHub issues with proper prioritization
- Send executive summaries to stakeholders

This led to the birth of **Watchman** - an autonomous security guardian for your codebase.

## 🏗️ How We Built Watchman

### Architecture Overview

Watchman follows a **microservices architecture** with clear separation of concerns:

### Core Components Deep Dive

#### 1. WatchmanOrchestrator (`orchestrator.py`)
The **brain** of the operation - coordinates all components:

```python
class WatchmanOrchestrator:
    def process_github_webhook(self, webhook_payload, repo_name, branch, commit_sha):
        # 1. Clone repository
        # 2. Run security scan  
        # 3. AI analysis of findings
        # 4. Create GitHub issues
        # 5. Send notifications
        # 6. Store results in database
```

**Key Innovation**: **Loop Prevention Logic**
```python
# Prevents infinite scanning loops when creating security fix branches
if branch.startswith('security-fixes-'):
    return {"skipped": True, "reason": "security_fix_branch"}
```

#### 2. SecurityScanner (`scanner.py`)
Powered by **Semgrep** with curated rulesets:
- `p/security-audit`: General security issues
- `p/owasp-top-ten`: OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities  
- `p/cwe-top-25`: CWE Top 25 most dangerous software errors

```python
def scan_repository(self, repo_path: str) -> Dict:
    cmd = [
        "semgrep",
        "--config", "p/security-audit",
        "--config", "p/owasp-top-ten", 
        "--config", "p/cwe-top-25",
        "--json", "--metrics", "off"
    ]
```

#### 3. BedrockAgentCore (`bedrock_agent.py`)
**AWS Bedrock-Powered Analysis Engine** with enterprise-grade AI:

```python
# Primary: AWS Bedrock with Claude 3.5 Haiku
client = boto3.client("bedrock-runtime", region_name="us-east-1")

def analyze_security_findings(self, scan_results, repo_context):
    response = client.converse(
        modelId="anthropic.claude-3-5-haiku-20241022-v1:0",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": [{"text": analysis_prompt}]}]
    )
    # Intelligent analysis with business context
    # Severity assessment with reasoning  
    # Actionable fix recommendations
    # Executive summary generation
```

**Mathematical Modeling for Severity Scoring**:
$$\text{Risk Score} = \frac{\text{CVSS Base} \times \text{Context Weight} \times \text{Exposure Factor}}{10}$$

Where:
- **CVSS Base**: Industry-standard vulnerability scoring (0-10)
- **Context Weight**: Business logic importance (1.0-2.0)  
- **Exposure Factor**: Code location criticality (0.5-1.5)

#### 4. GitHubHandler (`github_handler.py`)
Seamless GitHub integration:
- **Repository cloning** with authentication
- **Issue creation** with rich templates
- **Pull request management** for security fixes
- **Webhook payload processing**

### 5. **Enterprise AI Integration**

- **Multi-model support** (Claude 3.5 Haiku, Sonnet, Opus)
- **Automatic failover** to direct Anthropic API if needed
- **Bearer token authentication** for secure enterprise access
- **Region-specific deployments** for compliance requirements

### 6. **Real-time Dashboard**
Built with **Next.js** and **TailwindCSS**:
- **Live scan monitoring** with WebSocket updates
- **Security metrics visualization** 
- **Historical trend analysis**
- **Interactive scan result exploration**

## 🎯 What We Learned

### Technical Insights

**Async Architecture is Critical**
Initially, we built synchronous webhook processing, which caused GitHub timeouts. Moving to FastAPI's `BackgroundTasks` with AWS Bedrock's async capabilities was a game-changer:

```python
@app.post("/webhook/github")
async def github_webhook(background_tasks: BackgroundTasks):
    # Process immediately in background with Bedrock
    background_tasks.add_task(process_webhook_background, webhook_data)
    return {"status": "processing"}

async def analyze_with_bedrock(scan_results):
    # Non-blocking AWS Bedrock calls
    response = await bedrock_client.converse_async(
        modelId="anthropic.claude-3-5-haiku-20241022-v1:0",
        messages=messages
    )
```

**Lesson**: For webhook-based systems, **always respond quickly and process asynchronously** - AWS Bedrock's async APIs enable true non-blocking AI analysis.

#### 2. **AI Context is Everything**
Raw security scan results are often overwhelming. The breakthrough came when we started providing business context to AWS Bedrock's Claude models:

```python
# AWS Bedrock with rich context prompting
analysis_prompt = f"""
Repository: {repo_name}
Business Context: {repo_context.get('description', 'Unknown')}
Technology Stack: {', '.join(repo_context.get('languages', []))}
Team Size: {repo_context.get('team_size', 'Unknown')}

Please analyze these {len(findings)} security findings...
"""

response = bedrock_client.converse(
    modelId="anthropic.claude-3-5-haiku-20241022-v1:0",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": [{"text": analysis_prompt}]}]
)
```

**Lesson**: **Context transforms noise into signal** - Enterprise AI needs business understanding, not just technical data.

#### 3. **Loop Prevention is Non-Trivial**
When Watchman creates security fix branches, it could trigger infinite scan loops. We implemented multi-layer prevention:

```python
# Branch name filtering
if branch.startswith('security-fixes-'):
    return skip_scan()

# Commit message filtering  
if commit_message.lower().startswith('security:'):
    return skip_scan()
```

**Lesson**: **Autonomous systems need careful loop prevention** to avoid runaway processes.

#### 4. **Database Schema Evolution**
Started with a simple scan results table, but quickly needed rich metadata:

```sql
CREATE TABLE scan_runs (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    repo_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    branch TEXT NOT NULL,
    commit_sha TEXT NOT NULL,
    scan_status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending',
    -- Severity breakdowns
    critical_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    high_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    medium_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    low_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    -- Performance metrics
    scan_duration_seconds REAL,
    -- Timestamps for analytics
    scan_timestamp DATETIME,
    created_at DATETIME,
    updated_at DATETIME
);
```

**Lesson**: **Design for analytics from day one** - you'll want rich metrics sooner than you think.

### Product Insights

#### 1. **Developer Experience Matters**
Security tools often have terrible UX. We focused on:
- **Clear, actionable issue descriptions**
- **One-click fixes where possible**  
- **Executive summaries for non-technical stakeholders**
- **Beautiful, intuitive dashboard**

#### 2. **Integration Beats Features**
Rather than building yet another security scanner, we focused on **intelligent orchestration** of existing tools (Semgrep) with **AI-powered analysis**.

#### 3. **Real-time Feedback Creates Engagement**
The live dashboard with real-time scan progress keeps developers engaged rather than treating security as a "black box."

## 🚧 Challenges We Faced

### 1. **AI Infrastructure Scalability**
**Challenge**: Direct API calls for large codebases became expensive and hit rate limits quickly.

**Solution**: Migrated to AWS Bedrock for enterprise-grade AI infrastructure:
```python
# AWS Bedrock with automatic scaling and cost optimization
os.environ["AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK"] = bedrock_api_key
bedrock_client = boto3.client("bedrock-runtime", region_name="us-east-1")

# Intelligent batching with Bedrock's native optimization
response = bedrock_client.converse(
    modelId="anthropic.claude-3-5-haiku-20241022-v1:0",
    messages=batch_messages,
    inferenceConfig={"maxTokens": 4000, "temperature": 0.1}
)
```

**Learning**: **Enterprise AI infrastructure scales better** - AWS Bedrock provides automatic load balancing, cost optimization, and guaranteed availability.

### 2. **GitHub Webhook Reliability**
**Challenge**: GitHub webhooks can fail, timeout, or deliver out-of-order.

**Solution**: Implemented idempotency and graceful degradation:
```python
# Idempotency key based on commit SHA
idempotency_key = f"{repo_name}:{commit_sha}"
if self.database.scan_exists(idempotency_key):
    return {"status": "already_processed"}
```

**Learning**: **Webhooks are unreliable** - always design for failures and duplicates.

### 3. **Frontend-Backend API Synchronization** 
**Challenge**: During the hackathon, API endpoints were changing rapidly, breaking the frontend.

**Solution**: Comprehensive error handling and graceful degradation:
```typescript
const fetchData = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('/api/scans');
    if (!response.ok) throw new Error(`HTTP ${response.status}`);
    // Handle success
  } catch (error) {
    // Show user-friendly error message
    setError('Unable to load scans. Please try again.');
  }
};
```

**Learning**: **Robust error handling** makes development much smoother during rapid iteration.

### 4. **Semgrep Rule Tuning**
**Challenge**: Default Semgrep rules generated too many false positives.

**Solution**: Curated rule selection and custom filtering:
```python
# Focus on high-impact security rulesets
self.rules = [
    "p/security-audit",     # Core security issues
    "p/owasp-top-ten",      # Web application security  
    "p/cwe-top-25"          # Most dangerous errors
]
```

**Learning**: **Tool configuration is as important as tool selection** - defaults rarely work for production.
